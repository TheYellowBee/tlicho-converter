## What it does

- Type any Tłı̨chǫ word or phrase in Roman orthography
- Instantly see the **Practical Syllabics** equivalent
- Also shows the **IPA** (International Phonetic Alphabet) pronunciation
- Built-in special character panel — no Tłı̨chǫ keyboard needed
- Works on phone and desktop, fully offline after first load

## How to use

1. Open the link above in any browser
2. Type Tłı̨chǫ Roman text in the input box
3. Use the character buttons to add diacritics (ı̨, ǫ, ł, ɂ, etc.)
4. Copy the syllabics or IPA output with the Copy button

**Tip:** Nasal vowels (ǫ, ı̨) and tone marks (à, ǫ̀) affect the syllabics output — the more accurate your Roman input, the more accurate the syllabics.

## Examples

| Roman | Syllabics | IPA |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| tłı̨chǫ | ᖇᐠᗱᐠ | /tɬʰ ĩ tʃʰ õ/ |
| whaèhdǫǫ̀ | ᒐᐁᐧᑐ̇ᐠ | /ʍ a ɛ̀ h t õ̀ː/ |
| sı̨ godı | ᓯᐠ ᗂᑎ | /s ĩ k o t i/ |

## About Practical Syllabics

Tłı̨chǫ has traditionally been written in a syllabics system descended from the one developed by James Evans in the 1800s. The **Practical Syllabics** used in this converter is a revised, modernised system documented by [languagegeek.com](https://www.languagegeek.com) — designed to be more consistent and easier to encode digitally. It differs from the traditional syllabarium in some characters. Both systems are part of the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (UCAS) Unicode block.

## Technical notes

- Pure HTML + JavaScript, no frameworks, no server
- All syllabics data is embedded — works offline
- Based on **Tłı̨chǫ Practical Syllabics** (official orthography)
- Handles all 41 letters of the Tłı̨chǫ alphabet including digraphs (ch, tł, kw', etc.)
- Long vowels, nasal vowels, low tone, and prenasalised stops (nd, mb) all supported
