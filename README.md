## What it does

- Type any Tłı̨chǫ word or phrase in Roman orthography
- Instantly see the **Practical Syllabics** equivalent
- Also shows the **IPA** (International Phonetic Alphabet) pronunciation
- Built-in special character panel — no Tłı̨chǫ keyboard needed
- Works on phone and desktop, fully offline after first load

## How to use

1. Open the link above in any browser
2. Type Tłı̨chǫ Roman text in the input box
3. Use the character buttons to add diacritics (ı̨, ǫ, ł, ɂ, etc.)
4. Copy the syllabics or IPA output with the Copy button

**Tip:** Nasal vowels (ǫ, ı̨) and tone marks (à, ǫ̀) affect the syllabics output — the more accurate your Roman input, the more accurate the syllabics.

## Examples

| Roman | Syllabics | IPA |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| tłı̨chǫ | ᖇᐠᗱᐠ | /tɬʰ ĩ tʃʰ õ/ |
| whaèhdǫǫ̀ | ᒐᐁᐧᑐ̇ᐠ | /ʍ a ɛ̀ h t õ̀ː/ |
| sı̨ godı | ᓯᐠ ᗂᑎ | /s ĩ k o t i/ |

## About the Syllabics

Tłı̨chǫ is written today primarily in Roman orthography. A traditional syllabics system exists, based on the French/Catholic missionary tradition, but it doesn't distinguish all sounds of the language — for example, /j/ and /ch'/ share the same symbol, and fluent speakers infer the correct one from context.

The **Practical Syllabics** used in this converter is a proposed system developed by [languagegeek.com](https://www.languagegeek.com/dene/transdene/trans_dene_syllabarium.html) to more accurately represent Tłı̨chǫ sounds within the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (UCAS) Unicode standard. It has not been officially adopted by the community — think of it as a demonstration of what syllabics *could* look like for Tłı̨chǫ.

## Technical notes

- Pure HTML + JavaScript, no frameworks, no server
- All syllabics data is embedded — works offline
- Based on the proposed **Tłı̨chǫ Practical Syllabics** system by languagegeek.com
- Handles all 41 letters of the Tłı̨chǫ alphabet including digraphs (ch, tł, kw', etc.)
- Long vowels, nasal vowels, low tone, and prenasalised stops (nd, mb) all supported
